## Doxygen C/C++ Tutorial

* <https://darkognu.eu/programming/tutorials/doxygen_tutorial_cpp/>

~~~
The most important commands are:
    @file [filename]
~~~

This should be in huge red captital letters in [the actual documentation](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html), not stuffed in a barely-accented callout box 60% of the way down the damn page.

## How Wine works 101

I have never used epoll for more than network sockets, there were some neat finds in here.

Also shoutout to his funny/informative post [Rust is also C](https://darkcoding.net/software/rust-is-also-c/).

* <https://lwn.net/Articles/910435/>

Saw [this CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1012) get resolved and wrote our knowledgebase article about where we're (not) fixing it. Interesting to see the full explanation in plain terms.

## Using Netrw, vim's builtin file explorer

* <https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/using-netrw-vim-builtin-file-explorer/>

I should remember this, no need for NERDtree.

## How SNES emulators got a few pixels from complete perfection

* <https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/how-snes-emulators-got-a-few-pixels-from-complete-perfection/>

Every day without byuu/Near is our tragic loss. Fuck Kiwifarms.

## Time is an illusion, Unix time doubly so...

## Marek Majkowski's I/O multiplexing series

* <https://idea.popcount.org/2016-11-01-a-brief-history-of-select2/>
* <https://idea.popcount.org/2017-01-06-select-is-fundamentally-broken/>
* <https://idea.popcount.org/2017-02-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-broken-12/>

* <https://idea.popcount.org/2017-03-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-broken-22/>

Marek works for Cloudflare and writes lots of good posts [over on their blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/) too.

Funny to think that STREAMS might have won and networking would be very different!

Interesting that closing an `SO_REUSEPORT` socket causes the accept backlog to be cleared too.

## The (Almost) Definitive 486DX/50 Article (2023)

* <https://brassicgamer.blogspot.com/2023/01/the-almost-definitive-486dx50-article.html>

Good history of 486 CPU in the context of what a big deal it was. This entire blog is generally good and I read almost every post.

## SDL2 common mistakes and how to avoid them (2023)

* <https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/01/08/>

I have made all of these mistakes except one lol. I tried this but didn't like it. I want to use C99, not "SDL C".

## Lester (2023)

Awesome free metroidvania for Commodore 64. C64 games are usually pretty janky but this is excellent.

Played in RetroArch VICE with a gamepad, mapped additional button to Up for jumping.

Would it really have killed Commodore to put two buttons on the joystick?

Great reverse engineering and performance profiling!

Disables repeat on arrows and hjkl to get you to use motions properly

## vim-numbertoggle

* <https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle>

Uses hybrid relative numbers in normal mode, absolute numbers in insert mode. Not sure why absolute numbers are useful in insert mode?

## On leading underscores and names reserved by the C and C++ languages (2023)

* <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230109-00/?p=107685>

I knew these, but hadn't thought of English words like `strategy` or `island` or `together`.

## Using LSP & clangd in Vim (2018)

* <https://jonasdevlieghere.com/vim-lsp-clangd/>

This was about the most minimal C setup I could find. Then I realised it was [even more of a pest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70819007/can-not-use-clangd-to-read-linux-kernel-code) to get it working with the kernel, ugh. Back to gtags.

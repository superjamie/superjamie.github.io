## The (Almost) Definitive 486DX/50 Article (2023)

* <https://brassicgamer.blogspot.com/2023/01/the-almost-definitive-486dx50-article.html>

Good history of 486 CPU in the context of what a big deal it was. This entire blog is generally good and I read almost every post.

## arg.h A POSIX compliant argument parser based on plan9's arg(3)

## greatest - A C testing library in 1 file

## SDL2 common mistakes and how to avoid them (2023)

* <https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/01/08/>

I have made all of these mistakes except one lol. I tried this but didn't like it. I want to use C99, not "SDL C".

## Lester (2023)

Awesome free metroidvania for Commodore 64. C64 games are usually pretty janky but this is excellent.

Played in RetroArch VICE with a gamepad, mapped additional button to Up for jumping.

Would it really have killed Commodore to put two buttons on the joystick?

## How I cut GTA Online loading times by 70% (2021)

Great reverse engineering and performance profiling!

## vim-hardtime

* <https://github.com/takac/vim-hardtime>

Disables repeat on arrows and hjkl to get you to use motions properly

## vim-numbertoggle

* <https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle>

Uses hybrid relative numbers in normal mode, absolute numbers in insert mode. Not sure why absolute numbers are useful in insert mode?

## On leading underscores and names reserved by the C and C++ languages (2023)

* <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230109-00/?p=107685>

I knew these, but hadn't thought of English words like `strategy` or `island` or `together`.

## Using LSP & clangd in Vim (2018)

* <https://jonasdevlieghere.com/vim-lsp-clangd/>

This was about the most minimal C setup I could find. Then I realised it was [even more of a pest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70819007/can-not-use-clangd-to-read-linux-kernel-code) to get it working with the kernel, ugh. Back to gtags.

## High level mods/patches for console video-games (2023)

* <https://krystalgamer.github.io/high-level-game-patches/>

Some people are truly next-level.

## Compiled and Interpreted Languages: Two Ways of Saying Tomato (2023)

* <https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2023/compiled_and_interpreted_languages_two_ways_of_saying_tomato.html>

This reminds me on another (awful) blog post "If you don't know how compilers work, you don't know how computers work". The [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/66g27/if_you_dont_know_how_compilers_work_then_you_dont/) is infinitely better than the original blog. I should probably learn more about compilers.

## Ask HN: What do you talk about in 1-on-1s with your managers? (2023)

* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34329351>

Some good responses in here.

## Why Use Make (2013)

* <https://bost.ocks.org/mike/make/>

"Makefiles are machine-readable documentation that make your workflow reproducible" and discussion of a reverse-dependency graph rather than a forwards linear sequential recipe.

## Theory-building and why employee churn is lethal to software companies (2022)

* <https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theory-building/>

Seems to mostly be a summary of the paper [Programming as Theory Building](Programming as Theory Building) by Peter Naur from 1985, good tho.

## The Computer Science Book

Things you'll likely come across as a software developer.

## ARM Linux executable mysteriously runs on x86_64 (2016)

* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37912290/arm-linux-executable-mysteriously-runs-on-x86-64)

WOW! Not only that, there's a [binfmtc](https://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/binfmtc.html.en) which lets you run C programs as scripts.

## We invested 10% to pay back tech debt; Here's what happened (2023)

* <https://blog.alexewerlof.com/p/tech-debt-day>

Sounds like a dream place to work at. As the HN comments point out, this only works if the team cares about quality.

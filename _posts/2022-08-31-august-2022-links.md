title: August 2022 Links
---

In the tradition of [Laurence Tratt](https://tratt.net/laurie/) I've decided to start tracking useful links per month instead of saving them in Firefox forever.

## The Legend of Princess Kaguya

* <https://www.romhacking.net/translations/6614/>

NES adventure which tells the old Japanese folk tale of [The Bamboo Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter). Got a translation in 2009 but also got a new one in July 2022. Looks good for a NES game, similar interface to the ICOM/MacVentures (Deja Vu, Shadowgate, Uninvited).

## inotify command script

* [A simple shell script that uses inotify in Linux to run shell commands whenever files matching a pattern are changed.](https://gist.github.com/mpapi/4656389)

On spotty internet my VPN half-drops-out, keeping the tunnel and connection up but changing `/etc/resolv.conf` back to the non-VPN nameservers. So I am running this script on desktop login:

~~~
#!/bin/bash
inotifywait -q --format '%f' -m -r -e close_write /etc/ | grep --line-buffered -E "^resolv.conf$" | xargs -I{} -r sh -c 'notify-send --expire-time=3600000 "resolv.conf changed" "$(date)\n\n$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf)"'

## nullprogram (Chris Wellons) Blog

* <https://nullprogram.com/>

This was good enough for me to start following in Feedly. Examples:

* [A Tutorial on Portable Makefiles (2017)](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/08/20/)
* [strcpy: a niche function you don't need (2021)](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2021/07/30/)
* [Improving on QBasic's Random Number Generator](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/11/17/) - I've also done some hacking on QBasic's RNG for [Alphaman](https://github.com/superjamie/alphaman-src)
* [Function Pointers are Special (2010)](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2010/02/18/)

## A random number you already have: The stack address 

* <https://darkcoding.net/software/a-random-number-you-already-have/>

Due to ASLR on modern OSes. Keep the lowest 32 bits of a 64-bit stack address:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <inttypes.h>

int main(void)
{
        int32_t i = 0;
        int32_t r = (intptr_t) &i & 0xFFFFFFFF;
        printf("r = %" PRId32 "\n", r);

        return 0;
}
```

## ncursesw and Unicode

* <http://dillingers.com/blog/2014/08/10/ncursesw-and-unicode/>

I was idly thinking to make something compile both in DOS with Codepage 437 and Linux with Unicode. PDCurses on DOS [does support the wide functions](https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.md) with `PDC_WIDE`.

## Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard (2019)

* <https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-ergonomic-keyboard-review>

Update to the Sculpt seems even better than before, is wired (good), and a third cheaper (AU$100 vs AU$150). I'll get this next.

## Artistic Style (astyle)

* <http://astyle.sourceforge.net/>

A Free, Fast, and Small Automatic Formatter for C, C++, C++/CLI, Objectiveâ€‘C, C#, and Java Source Code.

~~~
astyle --style=linux --indent=tab --suffix=none --pad-comma *.c *.h

## Linux framebuffer palette switching

* <https://devurandom.xyz/blog/linux_framebuffer_palette.html>

This works with Solarized Dark too.

## Robert Elder's blog

* <https://blog.robertelder.org/>

Another I started following. Article examples:

* [Should I use Signed or Unsigned Ints In C?](https://blog.robertelder.org/signed-or-unsigned/)
* [Should I use Signed or Unsigned Ints In C? (Part 2)](https://blog.robertelder.org/signed-or-unsigned-part-2/)
* [The Most Confusing Grep Mistakes I've Ever Made](https://blog.robertelder.org/top-5-grep-mistakes/)

## POSIX Basic Regular Expressions (BRE)

* <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html>

From Elder above, this is the crappy regex that happens if you don't use `grep -E` to use Extended Regex. (which you should be using because [`egrep` is deprecated](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/383448/why-is-direct-invocation-as-either-egrep-or-fgrep-deprecated))

## Altynbek Isabekov's blog

Some nice low-level/C/radare posts:

* [A Radare2-based Analysis of Pointers to an Array in C](https://www.isabekov.pro/radare2-based-analysis-pointers-array-c/)
* [Stack alignment when mixing assembly and C code](https://www.isabekov.pro/stack-alignment-when-mixing-asm-and-c-code/) - I hit this problem at work too
* ["Signed Integer" behavior of "char" data type in C](https://www.isabekov.pro/signed-integer-behavior-char-data-type-c/)
* [Examining Data in GDB](https://www.isabekov.pro/examining-data-gdb/)
* [Writing a Minimalistic "Hello, World!" program with Position Independent Code in assembly language](https://www.isabekov.pro/writing-minimalistic-shellcodes-position-independent-code/)

## Unstripping Stripped Binaries

* <https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/symbols.html>

This guy earlier got UNIX versions of WordPerfect and Lotus-123 working on Linux too.

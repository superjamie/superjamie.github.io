## Ask HN: What was being a software developer like about 30 years ago?

Great thread!

It was possible to get your head around entire tech stacks. There was no internet, so books and magazines were more relevant, then usenet as it caught on. Everything was waterfall development with longer releases. There was little/no version control, backups, or testing. Everyone was rolling their own libraries (for better or worse). A developer today can be much more productive by leveraging existing content (often open source) with only a shallow as-needed knowledge about other components.

Picking RGB colors of CRT phosphor wavelengths. Amazing.

This site has kept track of tech layoffs since the start of 2020. Many let go at Twitter and Facebook this week as tech seems headed towards another bubble pop?

## Strange Loop Conference

I'd never heard of this before, but some good looking talks, there's a whole track on open source. I enjoyed:
